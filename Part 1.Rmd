## Derivatives in R

Find the Derivitive of $f(x) = 5x^2$

this stuff above is in Latex (different language)

```{r}
ex_1 <- expression (5 * x ^ 2)

my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x")
my_derivative

# I want to find the slope at x = 2.8

x <- 2.8
eval(my_derivative)

# a Word followed by a parentheses is a function
```

Find the slope of $f(x) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * z ^ 3 - 10.5 * z ^ 2 + 4.1)

dg_dz <- D(gz, "z")
dg_dz

#Let's evaluate the slope over a range of values

z<- seq(from = -3, to = 4, by = 0.5)

#Evaluate it!
eval(dg_dz)

```
